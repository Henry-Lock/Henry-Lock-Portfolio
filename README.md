# This portfolio contains two in-class projects from an R for Data Science Course

# The first is a project utilizing the historical climate data from Berkely Earth to analyze temperature changes in countries leading climate policies vs lagging in policy. This R file requires the data from Berkely Earth and your selection of countries. There is also a related presentation including the figures which were produced.

# The second project looks at five different gene TPMs by tissue files from GTEx, determines the top 10 variable genes for each tissue type and runs a linear regression of expression v age by sex, a logistic regression to classify the samples into male or female, and a PCA k-means clustering that classifies the top 1000 variable genes from the five tissue files into 2, 3, and 5 clusters. A pluthera of plots are also made to visualize and compare these models.

# In order to run, choose your files from the GTEx gene TPMs by tissue portal and change the file pathing in the reading section of the code.
